json2pojo
=========

JSON to POJO generator. A simple generator that creates Plain Old JAVA Objects from a given example JSON file.

=== Usage ===

 gem install json2pojo
 json2pojo <json_file> <base_class_name>

=== Notes ===

https://rubygems.org/gems/json2pojo

It currently supports integers, floats, dates, strings, lists and arrays and adds jackson annotation over the fields.

It does not generate the getter/setter methods as they can be generated by Eclipse with a single click.
